    <h1>You are always betrayed</h1>
    <p>
      Every now and then, in online chat rooms I hang around in, someone pops
      in and says something in the lines of,
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <span class="name">Truong Giang:</span>
      <p class="message">
        You are just a stupid piece of shit
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      And here's what you hear from
      <em>someone</em> else,
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <span class="name">Van:</span>
      <p class="message">
        You are useless and always get bad grades in school. You are such a stupid person.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      If you meet this type then throw it away because they are stupid too.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you get betrayed, don't care about your friends anymore, your parents always care about you and you don't
      need to care about them, it's tiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead let's think positively for example
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <span class="name">Chi:</span>
      <p class="message">
        If you have any difficult homework, please tell me.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Although it is a simple sentence, it will help us have some motivation in studying.
